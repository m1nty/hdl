## Computer-Aided Design using Verilog

<a name="objective"></a>
### Objective

To understand the fundamental coding templates used in an hardware description language ([HDL](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/what-is-a-hardware-description-language-hdl/)) for combinational and sequential logic circuits, to gain experience with the [Quartus](https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/overview.html) design synthesis environment and the [Modelsim](https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/model-sim.html) simulation environment, and to implement the hardware designs in the [Cyclone-IV](https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/products/programmable/fpga/cyclone-iv.html) field-programmable gate-array ([FPGA](https://www.eetimes.com/all-about-fpgas/)) on the [DE2-115](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&No=502) board.
